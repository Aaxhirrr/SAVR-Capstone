# SAVR Capstone (ASU)

This repository is the official GitHub repo for our ASU CSE Capstone project:

**SAVR – React to iOS & Android Mobile Application Transformation**

## Team
- **Aashir Javed**
: CS senior at ASU with a systems and backend tilt. I’m strongest in building production-style features: REST APIs, authentication and session handling, database schemas and queries, and service integrations. I also do frontend work in React/TypeScript and care about UX polish. On SAVR, I’m aiming to keep the mobile build structured and scalable, keep API payloads mobile-friendly, and ship a working core experience early so we can iterate fast.

- **Peter Forbes**
: CS major with 5+ years of full-stack development experience, but focusing on systems development in university. I have real world experience with React, Vue, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I am very excited to work hands on with developing native mobile applications, and I'm specifically interested in learning a modern native multi-platform app framework like React Native or Flutter. I can handle anything that's thrown at me, from API integrations to mobile UI design.

- **Alexander Wei** (collaborator)

## Purpose
We are working with our sponsor to help transform SAVR’s existing product experience into a mobile-first application, focusing on a functional implementation and a strong, modern frontend user experience.
