# SAVR Capstone (ASU)

This repository is the official GitHub repo for our ASU CSE Capstone project:

**SAVR — React to iOS & Android Mobile Application Transformation**

---

## Important Note (Early Work / Not Final Product)

This repository currently contains **wireframes, early prototypes, and initial sprint work from the first few weeks** of the project.

It is intended to document our early planning, UI direction, and foundational setup work.  
**It does not represent the final SAVR product** or the finalized production codebase.

Once our **official, production-ready codebase** is finalized and approved for release/sharing, we will add it to this repository (or link it here as the primary source).

## Team

- **Aashir Javed**: CS senior at ASU with a systems and backend tilt. I’m strongest in building production-style features: REST APIs, authentication and session handling, database schemas and queries, and service integrations. I also do frontend work in React/TypeScript and care about UX polish. On SAVR, I’m aiming to keep the mobile build structured and scalable, keep API payloads mobile-friendly, and ship a working core experience early so we can iterate fast.

- **Peter Forbes**: CS major with 5+ years of full-stack development experience, focusing on systems development in university. I have real world experience with React, Vue, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I am very excited to work hands on with developing native mobile applications, and I'm specifically interested in learning a modern native or cross-platform app framework like React Native or Flutter. I can handle anything that's thrown at me, from API integrations to mobile UI design.

- **Alexander Wei**: Senior in Informatics. I work on the UX/UI on this app, so making sure it looks nice and feels good to use. I have years of experience in graphic design and art. Not as much development experience, but I can pick things up pretty quickly and persist. Mostly excited to visibly contribute.

## Purpose

We are working with our sponsor to help transform SAVR’s existing product experience into a mobile-first application, focusing on a functional implementation and a strong, modern frontend-user experience.
